#summary How to Compile pForth on Unix or Mac
#labels Phase-Deploy
= Introduction =

We provide a simple Makefile for compiling.

= Details =

 # CD to "build/unix"
 # Enter: make all

This is a complete build. It will create an executable image and associated "pforth.dic" file in the "fth/" folder. You may need to remove the -C89 option from the Makefile if there are too many warnings.

It will also create a standalone executable image that includes the dictionary compiled inside. To run it enter: 

  ./pforth_standalone

= Testing =

 Enter: make test
