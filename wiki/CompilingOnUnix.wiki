#summary Compiling pForth on Unix or Mac
= Introduction =

We provide a simple Makefile for compiling.

 # CD to "build/unix"
 # Enter: make all

This will create an executable image and associated "pforth.dic" file in the "fth/" folder.

It will also create a standalone executable image that includes the dictionary compiled inside.
